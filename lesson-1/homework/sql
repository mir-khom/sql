Define the following terms: data, database, relational database, and table.
1. Data
Definition:
Data refers to raw facts, figures, or information that on its own may have no meaning. It can include numbers, text, images, audio, and more. When processed or organized, data can become useful information.

Example:
"John", "25", "New York" ‚Äî These are individual data elements about a person.

2. Database
Definition:
A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, modification, and management.

Example:
A customer database containing names, phone numbers, and purchase history of clients.

3. Relational Database
Definition:
A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables with predefined relationships between them. These relationships are established using keys (primary keys and foreign keys), and the structure follows the relational model proposed by E. F. Codd.

Example:
A school database with one table for Students and another for Courses, connected by a Enrollments table indicating which students are enrolled in which courses.

4. Table
Definition:
A table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns within a relational database. Each row (or record) represents a single entry, and each column (or field) represents a data attribute.

Example:
A Customers table with columns: CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone.

List five key features of SQL Server.



1. Data Storage and Management
SQL Server allows you to store, retrieve, and manage large volumes of structured data efficiently using relational tables, indexes, and schemas.

2. Security Features
SQL Server includes strong security mechanisms such as:

Authentication & Authorization

Role-based access control

Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

Row-level security
These protect data from unauthorized access.

3. Backup and Recovery
SQL Server supports comprehensive backup and restore options to prevent data loss, including:

Full, differential, and transaction log backups

Point-in-time recovery

High availability with Always On Availability Groups

4. Advanced Query Capabilities
SQL Server supports:

Complex SQL queries

Stored procedures, functions, and views

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions

Query optimization and execution plans for performance tuning

5. Integration and BI Tools
SQL Server provides tools for data integration and analysis, such as:

SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) ‚Äì for data migration and ETL tasks

SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) ‚Äì for creating reports

SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) ‚Äì for OLAP and data mining


  What are the different authentication modes available when connecting to SQL Server? (Give at least 2)


  1. Windows Authentication
Description:
Uses the Windows operating system credentials of the user. The user is authenticated by Windows before connecting to SQL Server.

Key Points:

Integrated security ‚Äî no need to enter a separate username/password.

More secure and easier to manage in domain environments.

Supports Active Directory.

Example:
Logging in automatically using your Windows login account.

2. SQL Server Authentication
Description:
Uses a username and password defined in SQL Server itself. This is independent of Windows accounts.

Key Points:

Requires manual login with credentials (e.g., sa user).

Useful for non-Windows clients or applications.

Must be explicitly enabled (called Mixed Mode Authentication when both modes are allowed).

Example:
Username: sa, Password: YourPassword123


  Create a new database in SSMS named SchoolDB.

  create database schooldb
  Write and execute a query to create a table called Students with columns: StudentID (INT, PRIMARY KEY), Name (VARCHAR(50)), Age (INT).
  create table students (studentid int PRIMARY KEY , name varchar (50), age int)
  Describe the differences between SQL Server, SSMS, and SQL

  1. SQL Server
What it is:
A relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.

Purpose:
Used to store, manage, and retrieve data in structured format. It runs as a service and handles databases, tables, queries, security, backups, and more.

Think of it as:
The engine or server that actually holds and processes your data.

2. SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)
What it is:
A graphical user interface (GUI) tool developed by Microsoft to manage SQL Server.

Purpose:
Used by developers and DBAs to write SQL queries, create databases, back up data, manage users, and monitor server activity.

Think of it as:
The workbench or interface you use to interact with SQL Server.

3. SQL (Structured Query Language)
What it is:
A programming language used to interact with relational databases.

Purpose:
Used to perform operations like creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating records, and deleting data.

Think of it as:
The language you speak to tell SQL Server what to do.


  Research and explain the different SQL commands: DQL, DML, DDL, DCL, TCL with examples.

  ‚úÖ 1. DQL ‚Äì Data Query Language
Purpose:
Used to query or fetch data from a database.

Main Command:
SELECT

Example:
sql
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
SELECT * FROM Students;
This retrieves all records from the Students table.

‚úçÔ∏è 2. DML ‚Äì Data Manipulation Language
Purpose:
Used to modify or manage data in existing tables.

Common Commands:
INSERT ‚Äì Add new data

UPDATE ‚Äì Modify existing data

DELETE ‚Äì Remove data

Examples:
sql
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
-- Insert a new student
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (1, 'Ali', 20);

-- Update a student's age
UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE StudentID = 1;

-- Delete a student
DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;
üèóÔ∏è 3. DDL ‚Äì Data Definition Language
Purpose:
Used to define or modify the structure of database objects (like tables, indexes, etc.).

Common Commands:
CREATE ‚Äì Create a new object

ALTER ‚Äì Modify an existing object

DROP ‚Äì Delete an object

Examples:
sql
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);

-- Add a new column
ALTER TABLE Students ADD Email VARCHAR(100);

-- Delete the table
DROP TABLE Students;
üîê 4. DCL ‚Äì Data Control Language
Purpose:
Used to control access or permissions to the data.

Common Commands:
GRANT ‚Äì Give access/permissions

REVOKE ‚Äì Take back permissions

Examples:
sql
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
-- Grant SELECT permission to a user
GRANT SELECT ON Students TO User1;

-- Revoke SELECT permission
REVOKE SELECT ON Students FROM User1;
üîÅ 5. TCL ‚Äì Transaction Control Language
Purpose:
Used to manage transactions and ensure data integrity.

Common Commands:
COMMIT ‚Äì Save changes

ROLLBACK ‚Äì Undo changes

SAVEPOINT ‚Äì Set a save point in a transaction

Examples:
sql
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age) VALUES (2, 'Malika', 19);

-- If everything is okay
COMMIT;

-- If there's an error
ROLLBACK;

  insert into students (studentid , name , age)
values
(1,'Abror',14),
(2,'Aziza',25),
(3,'Madina',24)

insert into students (studentid , name , age)
values
(1,'Abror',14),
(2,'Aziza',25),
(3,'Madina',24)
select * from students
